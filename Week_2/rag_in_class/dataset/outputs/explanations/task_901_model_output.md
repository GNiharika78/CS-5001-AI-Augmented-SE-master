## Original Code:

def smallest_multiple(n):
    if (n<=2):
      return n
    i = n * 2
    factors = [number  for number in range(n, 1, -1) if number * 2 > n]
    while True:
        for a in factors:
            if i % a != 0:
                i += n
                break
            if (a == factors[-1] and i % a == 0):
                return i

## Refactored Code:

```python
def smallest_multiple(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    i = n * 2
    factors = [number for number in range(n, 1, -1) if number * 2 > n]
    while True:
        for a in factors:
            if i % a != 0:
                i += n
                break
            if a == factors[-1] and i % a == 0:
                return i
```

- Preserved the exact function signature and return behavior
- Maintained the original logic flow without changes
- Kept all variables and control structures identical
- Used only standard library (no new dependencies)
- No side effects added (no prints, logs, etc.)
- Refactored only formatting (whitespace, indentation) for readability
- Preserved all edge cases and quirks from original implementation
- No algorithmic changes made
- All tests should pass with identical behavior
- Code remains at module scope with no nesting
